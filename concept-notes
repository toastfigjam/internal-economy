# Patterns of Extraction

### 1. Urgency as Default
When everything is “critical,” nothing is strategic.  
Reactive tasking replaces deliberate design, increasing decision latency and financial waste.

### 2. Metrics Without Meaning
Performance indicators measure throughput, not coherence.  
Teams optimize for activity instead of sustainable impact, creating data-rich but insight-poor environments.

### 3. Energy as an Untracked Asset
Attention, focus, and creative capacity are treated as infinite.  
Burnout, attrition, and cognitive fatigue are written off as individual failure rather than systemic loss.

**Observation:**  
Across high-performance organizations, these three patterns degrade ROI more effectively than any external competitor.  
Redesigning for rhythm and clarity restores adaptive intelligence, a true competitive advantage.
