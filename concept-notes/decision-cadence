# Decision Cadence

### 1. Definition
Decision cadence = the rhythm by which an organization makes, reviews, and integrates decisions.  

### 2. Problem
In urgency cultures, decision-making is reactive.  
There’s no distinction between tactical speed and strategic timing.  
The result: misaligned resource allocation, frequent rework, and cognitive fatigue.  

### 3. Principle
Healthy systems maintain variable pacing:
- **fast loops** for iteration and experimentation  
- **slow loops** for reflection, pattern recognition, and strategic direction  

### 4. Outcome
Introducing explicit cadence cycles increases quality of thought, reduces executive overload, and creates temporal coherence across teams.
