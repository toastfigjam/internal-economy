# Vitality Accounting

### 1. Premise
If energy drives all creative and economic output, then vitality is a measurable asset — not a “soft” factor.

### 2. Problem
Most organizations measure financial capital exhaustively but treat human energy as infinite.  
Fatigue, turnover, and disengagement represent *untracked losses*.

### 3. Reframe
Vitality Accounting introduces an additional balance sheet column:
- **Energy Assets:** focus, morale, clarity, engagement  
- **Energy Liabilities:** burnout, fragmentation, distrust  

### 4. Application
- annual vitality audit (anonymous indicators + pulse data)
- leadership dashboards integrating “creative recovery rate”
- energy ROI: mapping wellbeing interventions to measurable output gains  

### 5. Strategic impact
Energy-efficient organizations compound intelligence faster and reduce hidden costs.
